# Twain Land

## Introduction
Twain-land introduces the famous concentration game that both young and old enjoy playing. However, twain-land takes a little tweak by tending towards incorporating a flash card for learning about different countries in the world and pairing them with their corresponding flag colours. The application as of the moment focuses on some countries only in Europe and the program is currently built within the scope of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The application is fully responsive for the usefulness of users at their convenience. Twain-land intends to be educational and, hopefully, users through consistent usage can expand their recognition of existing countries' flags.
